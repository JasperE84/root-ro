# technically, everything is set up nicely now. Since ${rootmnt} had beend
# mounted read-only on the initfamfs already, ${rootmnt}/mnt/root-ro is it, too.
# Now we init process could run - but unfortunately, we may have to prepare
# some more things here.
# Basically, there are two ways to deal with the read-only root fs. If the
# system is made aware of this, things can be simplified a lot.
# If it is not, things need to be done to our best knowledge.
#
# So we assume here, the system does not really know about our read-only root fs.
#
# Let's deal with /etc/fstab first. It usually contains an entry for the root
# fs, which is no longer valid now. We have to remove it and add our new
# /mnt/root-ro entry.
# Remember we are still on the initramfs root fs here, so we have to work on
# ${rootmnt}/etc/fstab. The original fstab is ${rootmnt}/mnt/root-ro/etc/fstab.
